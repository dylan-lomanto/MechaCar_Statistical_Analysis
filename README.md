## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Vehicle length and ground clearance are both statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset, thus they are likely to have a significant impact on MPG
2. The p-value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the 0.05% significance level. This provides suffcient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the slope of the line is equal to zero.
3. This linear model does not effectively predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes because onloy two of the five variable show statistical significance. This is evidence of overfitting and means that the model fails to generalize and predict future data.
